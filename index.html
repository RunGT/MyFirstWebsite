          Hi Iâ€™m Glenroy-Terence, I would have introduced myself to you at the meets up as Terry for short. I know, a double barrel first name is majorly OTT. I promise I didn't have any choice in the matter. <br /><br />Welcome to my first website, other than using a little html for myspace circa 2006 or more recently creating a Bigcartel. For my site I have chosen a theme that reflects me and one of my interests. It has an coastal/sea theme as that is when Iâ€™m at my calmest and as you journey down the page I dive deeper into code (pun intended). <br><br>What an experience the application process has been so farâ€¦ The learning curve has been fast, challenging and rewarding. I never thought I would be jumping around and fist pumping the air debugging code or completing a kata, what a feeling when you crack it! FAC has been fantastic, itâ€™s been great pairing up at the meet ups and working with a diverse group of people. Itâ€™s so refreshing to see genuine collaboration and support.<br /><br />A little about me, I spent 12 years as an Technical Officer for London Underground and the Victoria Line Signals Upgrade. This involved mechanical and electrical fault finding on program machines and signalling circuits. I then went onto be a music producer and DJ for Sony / Virgin and BBC Radio 1xtra. Which turned into me being the first employee of a gaming start up as a project manager. Alongside the CEO we had to hire a team of developers without a developing background. I was working closely with this team deciding how the app would function and key design aspects. This is where my interest was sparked for coding. I now run my own business a craft hot sauce company. I built and designed a food brand which is stocked in Selfridges and has worked with high profile clients. I hope you can see I have the passion to learn and embrace new challenges.<br /><br />It is now time for me to utilise my experience a fulfil a burning desire to create tech. What I love about tech is that there is a genuine chance to change the world, on a community level or at scale. The fact that code can be reproduced digitally with marginal costs, means the possibilities are endless and cheap enough to be accessible to all. This it what fires my passion for coding. You can see from my career history it embodies everything I like to do. Being creative, helping others, problem solving and to continually evolve, while learning new skills and technology. I would relish the opportunity to join founders and coders to learn new skills and share my own, so we can all make a change for good in tech.

      Final Thoughts

    <p>
      I am so happy to have completed the FAC application. I have learnt so much already, from HTML and CSS to Javascript and this is just the start. When I first heard the term software developer it sounded like a dark mystical art. Donâ€™t get me wrong sometimes it still feels like a mystic art, the difference now is that I have had a peek behind the curtain. What I have learnt is that for every coding problem there is a multitude of solutions or a work around. There isnâ€™t one way of working or fixing problems, thinking outside the box and collaboration with others can fruit great solutions. Also coding isnâ€™t as solitary as it is portrayed, thereâ€™s a great developing community online and within FAC focused on helping each other, which in turn means as a developer, you are never alone. This site is just the beginning of my coding journey and Iâ€™m excited to see where it will lead.<br /><br />Iâ€™ll close on a reddit comment by Ray85g on a programming thread. â€™Being a developer is constantly feeling stupid because you canâ€™t solve a problem and then feeling like a genius when you do, and nobody caresâ€™ ðŸ˜‚
